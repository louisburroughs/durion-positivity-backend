Create an annotation class that takes a unique id as a parameter. The annotation applies to a method. The annotation should emit an event using the unique identifier and a timestamp at the beginning and end of the annotated method.
Integrate with Spring AOP

Create a module called pos-eventreceiver, scaffold the src folder for the new module
Configure the pom to use lombok and slf4j to log
Add a dependency for Spring data jpa to the pom
Inside of pos-eventreceiver create an emit reciever that has an API that posts an emitted event consisting of a id and a timestamp. The id should match an existing id that has been preregistered. The event should be stored in an h2 in-memory database. The preregistered id should be in another table in the h2 database. Use spring jpa to access the database and a dao layer to isolate the controller from the repository.


Create a module called pos-image, scaffold the src folder for the new module

Configure the pom to use Spring Data JPA to the pom
Create a controller that has a get APIs that lets you to look up an Image by id or by filename. Create DAO objects and Repository objects that use Spring JPA to look up ImageEntity from an h2 database. After looking up the ImageEntity object from the database, retrieve the image file from the filesystem and return it in the controller. The ImageEntity class has a String filename, a url image file location, a list of Strings called context and a Classification.  Classification is an enum with values of PUBLIC, CLASSIFIED, SECRET and TOPSECRET
